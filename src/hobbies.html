                </div>
                <p>Ever had the need to take a moment to stop and change your prespective?  For me, movies satisfy that urge.  I like to lose myself in other worlds. Whether they are entertaining tales or amusing adventures, they frequently inspire me with new concepts.I'm constantly struck by how characters persevere, support one another, and find hope even under the most trying circumstances. It is amazing how a great movie can change your outlook on life.At the end, it is during those silent moments following the film's ends that I come to appreciate how a those stories can change my viewpoint at the very moment I need it most.</p>

                <p>Whenever I need a mood boost or a respite from the daily grind, I turn to music. You'll rarely find me without my AirPods, whether I'm heading to class, going for a walk, or simply getting my day started. Ethiopian oldies musics  hold a unique place in my heart because they embody an unsaid depth that I can't fully articulate. It's the type of music that transcends time, combining exquisite melodies with moving lyrics. It's not just about listening them ; it's about feeling every note , letting the rhythm guides you . It's a reminder that no matter where life takes me, the rhythm of the past will always guide my heart home.</p>

                <p>Books have always given me a comfort zone, specially funny, light-hearted comedy books. But I also enjoy delving into books about Ethiopian history and I find it fascinating that knowing the past gives you a new perspective on the present and future.As the saying goes, 'without a past there is no future', and these books enrich my outlook on my history. Along the way, I have discovered some authors whose work really speaks to me. One of my favorites is Author Alex Abreham.I always look forward to his work.I've read almost all of his books, and each one gives me  new ideas and a greater appreciation for storytelling.</p>

                <p>I have a fondness  for vollyball began in high school, and since then, it has been my passion. It goes beyond the game —it’s about  hanging out with friends, feeling the rush of competition, and simply having fun. I've practiced and worked to get better, and I want to keep pushing myself further. It gives me that sense of release, and moment of focus, and I find both mentally and physically fulfilling. Beyond just a sport, it’s a way to connect with other , push myself, and  savour the small things in life. I'm looking  forward to continuing this journey and deepen my passion for the game.

I want to watch how a basic concept may be transformed into something visually striking masterpiece.</p>
